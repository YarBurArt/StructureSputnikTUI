# StructureSputnikTUI

Console application to see what disk space is occupied, displays destination folders and files with their size, requires only normal user rights for security purposes by bypassing access errors.  Runs asynchronously in multiple threads from a folder given to it, then sorts and outputs to the console. (This is something that will need to be fixed in the future)

[mini documentation](doc.md)

Open the sln file or read and build the code manually to run.
